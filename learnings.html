</head>

<body>

  <h1>Setup</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>Initialize Project: <code>npm init</code> - Create a new Node.js project and generate a <code>package.json</code> file.</li>
    <li>Install Parcel (Development Dependency): <code>npm i -D parcel</code> - Install Parcel as a development dependency, a web application bundler.</li>
    <li>Install React and ReactDOM: <code>npm i react react-dom</code> - Install React and ReactDOM for building user interfaces.</li>
    <li>Exec using npx > Start Development Server: <code>npx parcel index.html</code> - Use Parcel to bundle and serve your app with <code>index.html</code> as the entry point.</li>
    <li>Build for Production: <code>npx parcel build index.html</code> - Create a production build without specifying an entry point.</li>
    <li>Start Development Server with HTTPS: <code>npx parcel index.html --https</code> - Run the dev server with HTTPS enabled.</li>
  </ul>

  <h1>Dependencies</h1>
  <p>Dependencies are the packages your application relies on:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>React: <code>npm i react</code> - Library for building user interfaces.</li>
    <li>ReactDOM: <code>npm i react-dom</code> - For rendering React components to the DOM.</li>
  </ul>

  <h1>DevDependencies</h1>
  <p>DevDependencies are packages used for development and testing:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Parcel (as a devDependency): <code>npm i -D parcel</code> - A web application bundler used for development.</li>
  </ul>

  <h1>Transitive Dependencies</h1>
  <p>Transitive dependencies are packages that are not explicitly listed in your <code>package.json</code> but are required by your direct dependencies:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>These are managed automatically by npm to ensure your application's dependencies are met.</li>
    <li>No direct action is needed to manage transitive dependencies.</li>
  </ul>

  <h1>Parcel Features</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>Created a Server</li>
    <li>Hot Module Replacement (HMR): Allows you to see changes in your code without a full page refresh during development.</li>
    <li>Efficient File Watcher Algorithm: Real-time code updates using an efficient file-watching algorithm, possibly written in C++.</li>
    <li>Minification: Parcel can minify your code, reducing its size for production.</li>
    <li>Development and Production Builds: Parcel optimizes for each environment.</li>
    <li>Super Fast Build Algorithm: Known for its speedy build process, reducing development waiting times.</li>
    <li>Image Optimization: Parcel optimizes and bundles images for better performance.</li>
    <li>Caching: Parcel uses a <code>.parcel-cache</code> directory to cache files, speeding up subsequent builds.</li>
    <li>Variable Compression: Parcel performs variable file compression and other optimizations for efficient production bundles.</li>
    <li>Cross-browser Compatibility: Parcel ensures compatibility with older browsers through polyfills and transpilation.</li>
    <li>Code Cleaning (Babel Plugin Transform Remove Console) (e.g., Removing Console Logs): Parcel allows for code cleaning, removing debugging statements like <code>console.log</code>.</li>
    <li>HTTPS on Development Machine: Parcel supports serving your app over HTTPS on your local development machine.</li>
    <li>Port Number Handling: Parcel can manage port numbers for your development server to avoid conflicts.</li>
    <li>Consistent Hashing Algorithm: Parcel may use a consistent hashing algorithm for tasks like cache management.</li>
    <li>Zero Configuration: Known for its zero-configuration setup, requiring minimal setup and configuration.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>We need to import the react, react-dom/client</h2>


  <h2>Browserslist Configuration From Babel</h2>

  <p>The <code>browserslist</code> configuration specifies the browsers your project should support for compatibility. This configuration can be used by various tools, including Babel, to determine transpilation and CSS prefixing. It helps ensure that your web application functions correctly and looks consistent across different browsers.</p>

  <h2>What is Browserslist?</h2>
  <p><code>Browserslist</code> is a popular configuration file used in web development to specify a list of target browsers and their versions. It provides a clear way to define the browsers you want your project to support and helps developers and build tools make decisions about transpiling and optimizing code for specific browser versions.</p>

  <h2>Example Configuration</h2>
  <p>Here's an example of a <code>browserslist</code> configuration that specifies targeting the last two versions of the Chrome browser:</p>

  <pre>
    "browserslist": ["last 2 Chrome versions"]
  </pre>

  <p>In this example:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>"last 2 Chrome versions"</code> indicates that your project should support the most recent two versions of the Chrome browser.</li>
    <li>You can customize this configuration to target different browsers and versions based on your project's requirements.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Usage with Babel</h2>
  <p>When you use Babel for JavaScript transpilation, it can use the <code>browserslist</code> configuration to determine which ECMAScript (JavaScript) features to transpile or polyfill based on your target browsers. This ensures that your code remains compatible with the specified browsers.</p>

  <h2>Other Tools</h2>
  <p>In addition to Babel, other tools like Autoprefixer (for CSS prefixing) and PostCSS also make use of the <code>browserslist</code> configuration to apply appropriate transformations to your code.</p>

  <p>By defining your target browsers in the <code>browserslist</code> configuration, you can ensure a smoother cross-browser development experience and improved compatibility for your web projects.</p>

  <h2>Usage with Babel</h2>
  <p>When you use Babel for JavaScript transpilation, it can use the <code>browserslist</code> configuration to determine which ECMAScript (JavaScript) features to transpile or polyfill based on your target browsers. This ensures that your code remains compatible with the specified browsers.</p>

  <h2>Tree Shaking</h2>
  <p>Tree Shaking is a process in modern JavaScript bundlers (including Parcel) that eliminates unused code from your final bundle. It helps reduce the size of your JavaScript bundle by removing any code that is not actually used in your application. This is crucial for optimizing your application's performance and decreasing load times, especially for large web applications.</p>

  <h2>About Babel</h2>
  <p>Babel is a popular JavaScript compiler or transpiler that allows you to write modern JavaScript code (including ES6 and beyond) and transpile it into JavaScript code that can run in older browsers or environments. Babel is often used in modern web development to ensure cross-browser compatibility and to take advantage of the latest language features without worrying about browser support.</p>

  <p>When you configure Babel with your project, it can use the <code>browserslist</code> configuration to determine which JavaScript features to transpile or polyfill based on your target browsers. This way, Babel ensures that your code remains compatible with the specified browsers, allowing you to write modern JavaScript while still supporting a wide range of user environments.</p>

  <p>By using Babel and the <code>browserslist</code> configuration, you can confidently write modern JavaScript code and have it automatically transformed for compatibility with your target browsers.</p>

  <li>Code Cleaning (Babel Plugin Transform Remove Console) (e.g., Removing Console Logs): Parcel allows for code cleaning, removing debugging statements like <code>console.log</code>.</li>
   Create a Babel Configuration File: Create a .babelrc file in your project's root directory



   <h1>JSX (Html like syntax)(Not html inside js)</h1>
   <p>HTML-Like Syntax: JSX looks similar to HTML but is used within JavaScript code. For example, you can write JSX code that looks like HTML elements, complete with tags, attributes, and nesting.

    Embedding Expressions: You can embed JavaScript expressions within curly braces {} inside JSX. This allows you to dynamically generate content or insert variables into your JSX code</p>
