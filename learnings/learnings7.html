    <h1>Chunking or Lazy Loading or Dynamic Bundling or Code Splitting or</h1>

const Grocery = lazy(() => (import("./components/Grocery")))

we import it using the above lazy func which is provided by react

we may receive the error
As the react is fast af.. then milli secs gap for loading the js file for this
which will make the component of grocery wont be available
the react trys to load it

to handle that we have suspense component from react.

    <h1>Lazy Loading and Code Splitting in React</h1>

    <h2>Lazy Loading and Code Splitting</h2>
    <p>
        Lazy loading and code splitting are techniques used to improve the performance of a React application.
        They involve splitting the application bundle into smaller chunks, which are loaded on-demand as needed.
    </p>

    <h2>Loading Delay</h2>
    <p>
        When using lazy loading, there might be a slight delay in rendering a component for the first time.
        This delay occurs as the required chunk(s) need to be fetched from the server.
        React handles this delay automatically and can display fallback content, such as a loading spinner, during the loading process.
    </p>

    <h2>Error Handling</h2>
    <p>
        Error handling is crucial when dealing with lazy loading and asynchronous component loading.
        React provides mechanisms for handling loading errors gracefully.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Use the <code>Suspense</code> component to handle the loading of components and provide a fallback during loading.
        </li>
        <li>
            Implement an error boundary, such as <code>ErrorBoundary</code>, to gracefully handle errors that may occur during component loading.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Example Code:</h3>
    <pre>
        <code>
            &lt;Suspense fallback=&lt;div>Loading...&lt;/div>&gt;
                &lt;ErrorBoundary FallbackComponent={ErrorFallback}&gt;
                    &lt;LazyLoadedComponent /&gt;
                &lt;/ErrorBoundary&gt;
            &lt;/Suspense&gt;
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>
        By combining <code>Suspense</code> and an error boundary, you can ensure a smooth and error-tolerant experience for users when using lazy loading and code splitting in your React application.
