<h1>React lyf cycle >> describes the different stages a component goes through from its creation to its removal from the DOM</h1>
<p>whenever a class component is loaded a constructor is called then render is called.</p>
<p>consider a parent component and child component</p>
<p>in that case parent con, ren and then childs same stuff </p>

<p>we also have something called as componentdidmount >> which is triggred once the component has rendered onto the screen.</p>
<p>here if we consider parent n child
    then once child's component did mount then parent did mount
</p>
<p>componentDidMount:  used for side effects after the initial render. {empty dependency array in func component}</p>
<p>componentDidUpdate:  used for side effects after a re-render. setState >> {dependency array's}</p>
<p>componentWillUnmount:  used for cleanup before the component is removed.</p>

<h2>if we have multiple child constructors</h2>
<p>parent > c, r</p>
<p>child1 > c, r</p>
<p>child2 > c, r</p>
<p>react batches these both chidren</p>
<p>child1 componentDidMount</p>
<p>child2 componentDidMount</p>
<p>parent componentDidMount</p>

<h1>react optimizes these stuff</h1>

<h2>react has 2 phases >> render , commit</h2>

<pre>first mounting then updating then componentWillUnmount

    useEffect isnt equal to componentDidMount 
    
    after everyt update componentDidUpdate will be called
    </pre>
