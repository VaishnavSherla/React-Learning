<h1>Higher Order Component</h1>

<p>It takes a component and enhances or adds some features and returns a component.</p>

<h1>Lifting state up (For sending the data from child to parent)</h1>
<p>we are building the feature for collapsing the restaurant category when other category is opened all others shd be closed.</p>
<p>so we need to send the data to res category that it can manage by its the parent</p>
<p>so giving control to parent we need to send the props to res category</p>

<h2>Before Code (res category was able to manage state on its own)</h2>
<pre>
        const RestaurantCategory = ({data}) => {
            const [showItems, setShowItems] = useState(false)
              const handleClick = () => {
                setShowItems(!showItems)
              }
              return (
              <div className='w-6/12 mx-auto my-4 bg-gray-100 shadow-lg p-4  rounded-2xl'>
                  <div className='flex justify-between cursor-pointer' onClick={handleClick}>
                  <span className='font-bold text-slate-900'>{data.title} ({data.itemCards.length})</span>
                  <span>⬇️</span>
                  </div>
                  {showItems && <ItemList items={data.itemCards}></ItemList>}
              </div>
            )
          }
</pre>

<h2>so its like controlled(parent has control) n uncontrolled component.</h2>

<p>so we need to modify the state variable of parent from child now..</p>

<p>we cant do it directly but we can do it by passing the func as props</p>
