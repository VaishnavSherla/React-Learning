<h1>Props Drilling.. (Problem of passing props)</h1>
<p>if we want to send props from ancester to children</p>
<p>
    so we need its like we need global var
    where we can change stuff from any component.
</p>

<h2>so they are react context which are given react.</h2>

<p>createContext()</p>

<p>for same page we can use this useContext(contextName) - React Hook</p>

<p>for different page we need use it as consumer</p>
<p><userContext.Consumer>{(data) => {console.log(data)}}</userContext.Consumer></p>
  

<p>how to modify this userContext</p>
<p>by userContext.provider</p>
<p>by using the provider </p>
<p>by setting it through the useEffect then using the provider</p>
<p>we can provide the context for specifice portion(i mean by using the provider if we set any value )</p>

<p>we can also use the nested contexts</p>

<p>context comes directly from react we can make small size apps using context, we can also use contexts for large scale apps</p>
<p>but after some extent the if app size is huge and it needs to scale we will use the redux which is an external lib (we need to install it using npm) similar to zustand for managing state in react or other frameworks.</p>
