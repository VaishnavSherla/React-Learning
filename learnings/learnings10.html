<h1>Redux Store - Js Obj - kept in central space - For Managing Data.</h1>
<h3>install react-redux, also @reduxjs/toolkit</h3>
<h2>We have Slices in Redux Store So That Store Doesnt Become Clumsy.</h2>
<p>Its like making logical seperations </p>
<p>like themes, userinfo, cart slice, etc</p>

<p>we cant directly modify slice, when we click a button like add to cart we need to dispatch an action which calls a func which modifies cart slice</p>

<p>this function is called as reducer.</p>

<p>when we click on a button, which dispatches an action whihc calls a func , which modifies the cart slice (a slice of redux store)</p>

<h1>how to read data from cart slice?</h1>
<p>for that we use a selecter, which will give the data, for updating component</p>
<p>phenomenon is known as subscribing to store</p>
<p>component is subscribed to store(cart)</p>

<p>as its subscribed it will update atomatically.</p>


configuing app store

<!-- import { configureStore } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";
import cartReducer from "./cartSlice";

const appStore = configureStore({
    reducer:{
        cart: cartReducer,
    }
});

export default appStore;


cart slice

import { createSlice } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";

const cartSlice = createSlice({
    name: 'cart', 
    initialState: {
        items: []
    },
    reducers: {
        addItem: (state, action) => {
            state.items.push(action.payload)
        },
        removeItem: (state) => {
            state.items.pop()
        },
        clearCart: (state) => {
            state.items.length = 0
        }
    }
});

export const {addItem, removeItem, clearCart} = cartSlice.actions
export default cartSlice.reducer;

providing the store to app
<Provider store={appStore}>
    <>
        <Header />
        <Outlet />
        <Footer />
      </>
  </Provider>

subscribing to store..
const cart = useSelector((store) => store.cart.items)
